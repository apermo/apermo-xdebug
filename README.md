This plugin helps developers that use Xdebug.

## Description ##

This plugin helps you to read Xdebug messages inside the WordPress backend, without the need to adjust them everytime.
It simply indents the Xdebug messages, so that these are no longer partly hidden underneath the admin menu.
And it will also give you links to directly search for the error message on Google or Stackoverflow.

## Installation ##

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/apermo-xdebug` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the 'Apermo AdminBar' plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's all folks
